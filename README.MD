It is recommended to use a mod manager to install OverAchiever and all of its dependencies.

If you want to install it manually, load all of these mods as they are all required for OverAchiever to function and install them according to their respective install instructions:

* [Jötunn, the Valheim Library](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn)

Finally extract *all* of the contents of the OverAchiever mod archive into ```<Valheim>\BepInEx\plugins\OverAchiever``
